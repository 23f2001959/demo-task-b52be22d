# Snake and Ladder Game

## Summary
This project is a fully functional browser-based Snake and Ladder game implemented in a single HTML file. The game includes a 10x10 game board, two player tokens, dice rolling functionality, snake and ladder logic, turn tracking, winner detection, and a reset button. The game is built entirely with inline CSS and JavaScript, and does not require any external libraries.

## Setup
To play the game, simply open the HTML file in your browser. No additional setup is required.

## Usage
- Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice and move the player token.
- The current dice value will be displayed prominently near the "Roll Dice" button.
- Player 1 starts the game, followed by Player 2 on subsequent turns.
- Navigate the game board using the dice rolls and avoid snakes while climbing ladders.
- The first player to reach the 100th square is declared the winner.
- Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.

## Code Explanation
- The game board is rendered using HTML and styled with inline CSS.
- JavaScript logic handles dice rolling, player movement, turn tracking, snake and ladder positions, winner detection, and resetting the game.
- The game updates the dice value display after each roll and tracks player movement accordingly.
- Event listeners are used to handle button clicks for rolling the dice and resetting the game.
